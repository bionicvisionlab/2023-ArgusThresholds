## ArgusThresholds

Predicting Argus II thresholds from a variety of clinical and physiological factors.

To provide appropriate levels of stimulation, retinal prostheses must be calibrated to an individualâ€™s
perceptual thresholds, despite thresholds varying drastically across subjects, across electrodes within a subject, and over time. 

Although previous work has identified electrode-retina distance and impedance as key factors affecting thresholds, an accurate predictive model is still lacking.

To address these challenges, we set out to develop explainable machine learning (ML) models that could:
- predict perceptual thresholds on individual electrodes as a function of stimulus, electrode, and clinical parameters
- infer deactivation of individual electrodes as a function of these parameters, and
- reveal which of these predictors were most important to perceptual thresholds and electrode deactivation

This repository contains the implementation of the work presented in [Explainable Machine Learning Predictions of
Perceptual Sensitivity for Retinal Prostheses](https://github.com/bionicvisionlab/2023-ArgusThresholds), where these challenges were studied.

   * For for regression tasks:
      * `ignore_outliers` = True
      * `keep_nans` = False
      * `min_samples` = 50
      * `scale_thresholds` = 'first' if and only if `mode` is 'fitting' or 'followup'
